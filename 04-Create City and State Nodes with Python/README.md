## Learning Objective

Let's create nodes for each of the states in the United States of America (USA).
Once each of those nodes has been created, we'll create nodes for each city with a population larger than 100,000.
In order to differentiate cities from states, we'll need to associate a "label" with each node: `:city` or `:state`.

I'll be referring to the geonames data that's freely available [here](http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/).
I've already filtered the US data set down to just cities and states.
