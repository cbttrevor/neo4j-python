## Learning Objective

Before we get started with code, you'll need to make sure that you have the appropriate tools installed on your system.
For a graphical coding interface, we'll use Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
Of course, because this skill is focused on Python, you'll need a Python runtime.
Instead of installing Python directly onto our developer workstation, we'll use Docker Desktop to spin up a Python container.

The `remote-containers` extension for Visual Studio Code allows you to run VSCode against a container development environment.
